title: Hello Github!

I've had personal websites in the past, hosted all over the place – Squarespace, Linode, etc... but I always end up back on Twitter (which is still the likely outcome of this – you can find me @_timcarroll).

I usually post only a few times a year and can't justify the expense of those services. But Twitter is becoming a bit of a shit show at the time of this writing (early 2018), so I'm going to get back in the game of owning my own content.

Today I found out about this neat Github pages thing. I realize I'm late to the party. It took me about five minutes to set up a blog hosted on Github for free. You can do the same by following the [instructions here](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/).
